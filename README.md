<h1> AP CS Spring Final Project </h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> Our final project is a simulation of an aquatic environment involving fish. The user is able to see how various environmental factors such a pH level, sunlight level, and temperature affect the number of fish. The user is also able to see how the fish population itself becomes a limiting factor. </p>
<h2> How to Use our Program </h2>
<p> After opening the Tank folder, you can run the program. You will be allowed to choose to use a default environment or to create your own environment. If you use the default environment, the environmental factors will already be pre-determined. If you choose to create your own environment, you will be prompted to input the number of fish, pH levels, and temperature. Then you will see how your fish population will thrive in those conditions. In both choices, you may alter environmental factors such as pH and temperature over the course of the simulation to see the effects on the fish population. You may also add additional fish at a certain location by pressing your mouse there. </p>
